# Other Repos
Some of my other repos include:
- Computer-Science-Class: A variety of small Python programs from my school Computer Science class. Feel free to use them for whatever.
- DOS-Collection: A curated "C: Drive" for use in DOSBOX. Includes a variety of DOS games, plus Windows 3.1 with STARS! 2 installed.
- FTL-TextEdition-Legacy: My first actual "game" that wasn't less than 50 lines of code, inspired by the hit indie game FTL: Faster Than Light. Includes several random events, upgrades for your ship that can be paid for with currency, battles, music, a boss fight and a handful of bugs I don't feel like fixing. Originally coded in C++ and hacked togther with gotos and duct tape, I am currently redoing it in Python with far more features and flexibility. (See FTL: Text Edition in the nav bar)
- captainhaywood.github.io: The repo with the source for this website.
