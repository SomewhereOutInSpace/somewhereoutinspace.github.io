# Other Repos
Some of my other repos include:
- Computer-Science-Class: A variety of small Python programs from my school Computer Science class. Feel free to use them for whatever.
- FTL-TextEdition-Legacy: My first actual "game" that wasn't less than 50 lines of code, inspired by the hit indie game FTL: Faster Than Light. Includes several random events, upgrades for your ship that can be paid for with currency, battles, music, a boss fight and a handful of bugs I don't feel like fixing. Originally coded in C++ and hacked togther with gotos and duct tape, I have made a spiritual successor to this game in Java. (See Sunward in the nav bar.)
