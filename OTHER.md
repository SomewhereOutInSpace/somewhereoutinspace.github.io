# Other Repos
Some of my other repos include:
- Computer-Science-Class: A variety of small Python programs from my school Computer Science class. Feel free to use them for whatever.
- Wildlife-Generation-Sim: A tiny C++ program I put together in half an hour after playing too much of Conway's Game of Life. It essentially just has two numbers - an amount of deer and amount of resources. Using a set of simple rules, the amount of each number will change with each iteration of the rules.
- DOS-Collection: A curated "C: Drive" for use in DOSBOX. Includes a variety of DOS games, plus Windows 3.1 with STARS! 2 installed.
- FTL-TextEdition: My first actual "game" that wasn't less than 50 lines of code, inspired by the hit indie game FTL: Faster Than Light. Includes several random events, upgrades for your ship that can be paid for with currency, battles, music, a boss fight and a handful of bugs I don't feel like fixing.
- captainhaywood.github.io: The repo with the source for this website.
