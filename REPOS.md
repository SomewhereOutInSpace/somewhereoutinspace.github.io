# Games/Programs
- [Sunward](https://github.com/SomewhereOutInSpace/Sunward): A text-based space roguelike, vaguely based on FTL: Faster Than Light, that I coded over a few days.
- [PyChat](https://github.com/SomewhereOutInSpace/PyChat): A Python internet chat client and server that I somehow made in 8th grade. No I do not understand the code, I just know that it works.
- [FTL-TextEdition-Legacy](https://github.com/SomewhereOutInSpace/FTL-TextEdition-Legacy): Text based FTl clone, the predecessor to Sunward. Made in C++. Certified Goto soup.
