# Rimworld Mods

From the workshop page:

Transmution is an efficient, reasonable late game way easily acquire vital resources without it feeling like cheating. Unlike other replicator mods, Transmution both requires you to input a resource to convert, and requires a special, expensive power source to further prevent abuse. I would especially recommend this mod to:
[list]
[*]Anyone playing on a map with limited crucial resources, like an ice sheet or a flat forest
[*]Anyone who likes long-term colonies but encounters problems with metal supply as the map is mined out
[*]Anyone who just wants to circumvent annoying resource shortages
[*]The 5 people with a supercomputer and 150 hungry colonists to feed (transmute some tasty tasty nutrient paste)
[/list]

The main part of the mod, Transmution Reactors can convert raw resources into other raw resources, and can also convert more specific ingredients into higher-tier resources. For example, you can turn wood into bluefur, and then turn that bluefur (or other textile) into devilstrand.

Generally the conversion rate is 10-10, but may change for higher-tier resources to prevent abuse. For example, 10 wood can be turned into 10 steel, but 10 wood will only equate to 5 plasteel.

There are also bulk recipes for certain resources, such as steel, where a 100 raw resources are converted into a 100 of the target resource.

Transmution Reactors cost 500 steel, 250 plasteel, 25 component, 25 advanced component, and 50 uranium to build.

An advanced power storage solution created from uranium, plasteel and components at a fabrication table, this is the only power source available for Transmution Reactors. Even then, active use of a Reactor can drain the cells very quickly. Have a lot of uranium on hand, or transmute some before you run out of power. This is one of the limiting factors that helps Transmution feel reasonable.

One power cell costs 5 uranium, 5 plasteel, and 2 components.

[h1]Voxels[/h1]

[i]Energy is matter and matter is energy.[/i]

Voxels are a resource produced for "free" at a transmution reactor, and can be used as a substitute for raw materials in transmution. The catch comes in the fact that voxel production drains reactor fuel quickly, and that voxels are considered a small-volume ingredient, like gold or silver. This means you need ten times as many voxels as input to transmute a resource.

However, they do have their uses. For example, if you are stuck in a prolonged toxic fallout with no cheap resources to transmute, voxels could make all the difference.

[h1]Research[/h1]

[i]The science isn't easy, but it's worth it.[/i]

Transmution adds a new research tree that gates off transmution of more advanced materials. By default, you can only convert raw materials to wood, voxels and marble blocks. However, through the use of various research nodes, you can unlock metals, textiles, medical supplies, food, components, liquids, and drugs.

[h1]Other Info[/h1]

[list]
[*] Transmution doesn't have any dependencies, and shouldn't cause any conflicts. Let me know if it causes a serious problem, but I doubt it will. Feel free to drop it into your ongoing saves, and if you want to remove it, make sure you remove anything this mod adds before you do so.
[*]I believe I've balanced this as best I can, but if you stumble across some ridiculous exploit, be sure to let me know and I'll tweak the relevant numbers.
[*]If there's enough demand for it, I'd be glad to release additional patches/modules that add in the transmution of additional resources, like shells, apparel, weapons, etcetera.
[*]If you complain about this mod being OP in the comments, prepare to be ignored. Don't like it? Don't subscribe to it. Easy.
[*]If you do like Transmution, give it a thumbs-up so the Workshop algorithm will give it some time in the limelight. Thanks!

## Rimmunizations

From the workshop page:

Adds in immunization medications that grant immunity to a specific disease for a quadrum. Later game research can also allow for the creation of bulk doses for all natural diseases or mechanite diseases. 

Bulk immunization doses cost 4 Neutroamine and 100 work. Single-disease immunization doses cost 2 Neutroamine and 50 work. 

Immunizations only prevent new diseases from occurring; they do not cure existing infections, including ones that are not yet visible.

Great for giving your hospital something to do when nobody's sick or dying.

IMPORTANT: Rimmunizations is very Neutroamine-heavy, especially with large populations. At the risk of inciting a heated debate, I have not included the ability to manufacture Neutroamine in Rimmunizations. However, I would recommed that you install a mod that allows you to manufacture Neutroamine.

Also, no, it doesn't cause autism. Please stop.
