# About Me
I'm SomewhereOutInSpace, hailing from the great cornfields and meager cities of Central Indiana. In terms of coding, I'm best with Python, but I know some Java and C#. 

What you'll see on here:
- Homemade Games (Text based or basic GUI)
- Rimworld Mods (Made with XML and maybe C#)
- A few miscellaneous programs
- My school CompSci work (Python and Java)

What I like to do:
- Programming (obviously)
- Building model rockets 
- Playing unhealthy amounts of video games
- Reddit
