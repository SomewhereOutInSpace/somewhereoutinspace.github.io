# About Me
Hey, I'm James, a garden-vaiety high school student hailing from the great cornfields and meager cities of Central Indiana.
I specialize in writing hacked-together code and pretending I have the know-how to code actual games. I'm most familiar with Python and Java, but I know my way around C# and a few other languages as well. This Github is mostly used as a dump for all my CS class code, plus the slowly decaying corpses of my old projects.
