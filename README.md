# About Me
Hi!
I'm CaptainHaywood. Most of what you'll see from me will be text-based games and programs made in C++, although you may find a Tkinter application here and there. I'm currently working on The Forever War, a text-and-turn-based galactic conquest strategy game. Some of my hobbies include:
- Programming (obviously)
- Building model rockets 
- Playing unhealthy amounts of video games
- Reddit
