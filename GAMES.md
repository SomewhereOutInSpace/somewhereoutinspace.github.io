## AURORA (Tkinter-based)

[Pages Site](https://somewhereoutinspace.github.io/AURORA-Clicker/)

![logo](http://imgs.fyi/img/7t3c.png)

AURORA is an incremental clicker game inspired by SPACEPLAN. The game is coded purely in Python 3.6.7, and features:

* A full Tkinter-based GUI
* Music and SFX
* Sparse, simple but well-placed graphics
* A full beginning to end story spread out via the clicker mechanic, delivered by ODIN, your shipboard AI
* A codex, with lore goodies
* Save game

AURORA can be run in the background, and could realistically be completed over the course of a work or schoolday, with the player checking in from time to time to progress the story and fabricate new modules and upgrades. After the conclusion of the storyline, the game will go into infinite mode, for those who like watching meaningless numbers go up very, very quickly.

Source code as well as Windows executables can be found on the release page. (once I've finished it lmao)

Please report any bugs under the Issues tab in the repository.

## Sunward (Text-based)

Sunward is the spiritual successor to my old C++ game FTL: Text Edition (which you can find below.) It very much continues in the same vein, with you progressing through increasingly difficult enemies to reach an ultimate goal. However, unlike FTL: Text Edition, Sunward is designed to be much shorter and sweeter, with more focus on replayability and the mantra of "live, die, repeat."

### The Game

Sunward puts you in the place of an interplanetary ship pilot, just as a surprise announcement comes out - the Sun is going to go nova, and it's going to do so _very soon._  In the words of the starting scroll:

```
Your ship is currently outside the orbit of Saturn, and is burning sunwards at maximum acceleration.
You need to reach the stargate in orbit of Mercury to leave the Solar System before the Sun goes nova.
Unfortunately, it won't be easy. Many desperate souls want out of here, but few have a ship.
Expect to be attacked countless times on your way... Sunward.
```

You've got to fight your way down to the Sun, and it won't be easy. Good luck!

## The Seven Suns (Text-based)

[Pages Site](https://somewhereoutinspace.github.io/The-Seven-Suns/)

My first decent, non-buggy and well-coded game made in Python after I played too much *Elite*.

In the distant future, where man can traverse the endless light-years between the seven stars of the Unified Stellar Republic in a heartbeat, you have acquired your first spacecraft. Little more than a hypergate-capable shuttle, you must trade and fight your way to the top - or die trying.  It's a harsh galaxy, where pirates roam the furthest reaches of space and no one will come to help you, even if they hear your cry.  Can you survive and thrive among The Seven Suns?

The Seven Suns is a Python game I made over the course of about two weeks in my school Computer Science class. It has exactly 1693 lines of code, and includes a .py file that uses cx_Freeze to create a windows executable of the game, if you so desire.

Some features include:
- Several handmade star systems with unique descriptions of each body, different prices for goods, and danger levels.
- Saving and loading games
- Random turn-based battles when travelling, against enemies with random stats, plus different moves with varying effects and ammo
- Multiple ships (and upgrades) to purchase with different capabilites and capacities
- Trading various goods between star systems for profit
- Sound effects and battle music


## FTL: Text Edition (Text-based)

[Repository](https://github.com/SomewhereOutInSpace/FTL-TextEdition-Legacy)

A text-based recreation of the indie hit FTL: Faster Than Light. Poorly coded in C++, I'm only putting it here for brevity. If you want to try it out and laugh at it, be my guest. I've made a spiritual successor of sorts in the form of *Sunward* (see above.)
